# The (SHHHH) Minigame Station

Welcome to the sacred games station where you can enjoy games. Not just some ordinary web games, but thoooooose games. You know what i mean don't you. Just clone the repo using the command ,

```
git clone https://github.com/mrhamana/minigames
```

then launch a live server however you want .Then play to your heart's content. Everything is made only using HTML , CSS and vanilla JavaScript. No More . Shows you that's all you need . None of the modern bloat called "FRAMEWORK!!".

Any changes made to the repo is highly appreciated . Was a hobby project and would be fun to know how dumb i am by pointing out that i dereferenced a nullptr equivalent in JavaScript. Anyways , happy hacking!!
